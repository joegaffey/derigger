# De Rigger

In progress fashion mandated sim rig builder.

Check it out [here](https://derigger.glitch.me/)!

Change the comma separated values in the text area to modify the rig.

Each row represents a part:

Part/model name, x, y, z (scale), x, y, z (position), x, y, z (angle)

Add or remove rows as needed.

Only have an "8040" profile model for now.
More can be added if any interest.

The profile model is 1mm so scale the z axis to get the appropriate length.  
Edit the example text to get started.  
Click "Update" to ewbuild the 3D model.
